# Overview
This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) coding challenges for 2015.  Solutions are done using Scala 2.11.4.

All work is original and free to use.  I do encourage you to come up with your own solutions, but if you have questions or just want to see alternatives, feel free to use my code.  Happy coding!
